Additionally, instead of the old-fashioned method of describing pictures from books, allow us to create a unique image for you; simply describe what's in your mind.\n\nConversations will be tailored according to your proficiency level by definition. However, we strongly recommend activating the Lexicon feature: from the Menu, via Settings to Personal Details, to ensure that conversations are personalized to your vocabulary from the Glossary.

Isn't that really amazing? This is what truly sets Speak Up apart and makes it a game-changer!\n\n**Lexicon Function:** \n\nThis is what distinguishes Speak Up and makes it a revolutionary power in language education. Imagine having conversations tailored precisely to your personal vocabulary. Don’t miss this aspect: if your vocabulary consists of 1000 words, our app ensures that your interactions with the teacher utilize exclusively those words, creating a seamless learning experience. By doing so, we empower you to solidify your existing vocabulary without overwhelming you with a barrage of new and potentially confusing words. You'll find yourself effortlessly incorporating previously learned words into your speech, strengthening your language skills subconsciously. Rest assured; new words are introduced only when absolutely necessary. However, if your goal is to expand your vocabulary, simply switch off the Lexicon feature. This allows you to engage with the teacher at your current proficiency level, opening the door to a carefully curated selection of new words that match your skill level perfectly.\n\n**Vocabulary Studying and Testing Process:**\n\nAnother standout feature of Speak Up is its innovative approach to vocabulary learning and testing. Here, you have the flexibility to choose between Translation and Definition features. For students at higher proficiency levels, studying new words through their definitions provides a deeper understanding and facilitates advanced language comprehension. On the other hand, for beginners at A1 levels, learning new words through translations in their native language is more accessible and effective learning method.\nAnother advantage of the app is effortless vocabulary expansion: simply tap on any unknown word while reading a text to view its translation, and the system will automatically add it to your vocabulary for learning.\n\n**Chatterbox:**\n\n Say goodbye to traditional methods of language practice! With Speak Up’s Chatterbox feature, we're revolutionizing the way you express yourself. No more dull descriptions of pictures from textbooks—instead, let us ignite your imagination. Simply describe the scene you envision, and we'll transform it into a vibrant, tailor-made image just for you. It's a fun and engaging way to unleash your creativity while honing your language skills.\nFor a comprehensive overview of all the features designed to enhance your learning experience, we invite you to explore the full presentation of Speak Up. Discover dozens of other tools and resources meticulously crafted for your convenience and effortless study journey. With Speak Up, fluency is within reach like never before.",

Let us serve you by creating your very own real-time talking avatar, in other words a \"digital you,\" crafted from your photos and videos. This avatar will be seamlessly integrated into the app, enabling your students to engage in conversations with their personalized digital teacher. Imagine the possibilities: your students interacting with \"digital you\" in real-time conversations. It's a truly remarkable feature that has now become a reality!\n\nWith Speak Up, every teacher affiliated with us gains access to their own personalized conversational app. Moreover, our associated teachers enjoy special group discounts as part of our commitment to supporting educators. Contact us for details.\nBut perhaps the most significant benefit of Speak Up is its role as your personal tutoring assistant. As a language teacher, you may find that teaching grammar, reading, and writing leaves limited time for conversational practice during lessons. Traditional methods such as large weekly conversational groups often fall short, with each student receiving minimal interaction time. To illustrate, in a scenario where a 60-minute group conversation session involves 10 students, each student receives only 6 minutes of individual attention.\nThis is where Speak Up steps in as your invaluable time-saving solution. Our app actively engages your students in after-class conversations and vocabulary building exercises, ensuring that speaking skills are reinforced and strengthened outside of regular lesson hours.",
